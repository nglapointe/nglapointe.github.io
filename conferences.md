Conferences
 I'm not a big conference person, I know they are great for networking and I do recommend attending them. Introverts have difficulty navigating in-person conferences as they are mentally draining which is why I absolutely love virtual conferences. This section will contain all the conferences I attended throughout the years starting in 2019... when I started actually actively pursuing conferences and began to blog about them.
