   Thanks for visiting my blog, I hope you find this place a great resource to learn and share. I started this thinking it would be a nice place to keep all my documentation in one place, online and organized but the more time I invested myself into this, the more I thought it was my way to give back to our amazing information security community.

   I have a great deal of passion for Information Security and surround myself, professionally, with like-minded individuals that enjoy giving back to the community and want to be better and make others better everyday.

   All I ask from you is to keep your comments productive, constructive and professional. My parents ingrained the mantra "If you have nothing nice to say, please keep it to yourself." early in life and I simply ask the same of you.

   Thanks for stopping by and again, I hope you find this space worthy of a bookmark to reference when needed.
