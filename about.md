I'm a husband and father first, Security professional second. I have a great passion for defending technology against novel and creative tactics, techniques and procedures. To reverse the adversaries advantage and spread my knowledge amongst the Information security community.

Together we can build a strong and resilient foundation that will defend against known and unknown threats. I enjoy surrounding myself with professional like-minded individuals that enjoy giving back to the community and want to be better and make others better everyday.

Think Big
Start Small
